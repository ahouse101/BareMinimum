BareMinimum
===========

NOTE: This GitHub page is here for the convenience of GitHub users. My main repository is still on CodePlex, and that is also where I maintain the most up-to-date information as well as binary packages. For that stuff, check out http://bareminimum.codeplex.com/. 

BareMinimum is a grade tracking program with one major purpose: it gives you minimum scores you can get on individual grades while still achieving your desired overall grade in a class. 

I'd like to stress that this is not a tool for slacking; this tool is to help you maximize your time. It allows you to see which grades are going to affect your grade the most. If you've spent a little too much time, say, practicing piano, BareMinimum will help you figure out what your most urgent priorities should be. It'll also tell you if it's even possible for you to get that grade you need (or if you should perhaps set your sights lower, and learn the lesson for next time). 

Another fun thing you can do is experiment with different grades very easily. "What if I'd flunked that test? Could I still have passed?" you ask yourself. Well, BareMinimum has the answer. Sometimes, experimenting can be fun in and of itself (just don't let it get in the way of actually passing your classes!).
