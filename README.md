BareMinimum
=========== 

BareMinimum is a personal gradebook program, with one special feature: given your desired grade in a class, it can calculate the minimum possible grades you can get on individual assignments and tests.

A detailed changelog can be found in the BareMinimum directory; this file contains future plans and bugs, as well. The BareMinimumCore project contains all code related to the math and data structures of the application; all frontend code is in the BareMinimum project.

NOTE: Up to date sources are available on both GitHub and CodePlex, but all binary packages are on CodePlex exclusively.
