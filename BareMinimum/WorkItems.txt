Future Plans:
	- Add miscellaneous calculations, such as GPA, into a separate menu.
	
Version 1.0 - Release
	Goal: Release!

Version 0.9 - Alpha
	Goal: Do the final tests and package the application for distribution.

Version 0.8 - Beta
	Goal: Fix bugs.

Version 0.7
	Goal: Polish existing features, get rid of hacks if possible, create help, and publish the Codeplex project.

Version 0.6
	Goal: Add templates, custom calculation modes, and options.

Version 0.5
	Goal: Add file support.

Version 0.4
	Goal: Add the methods that will do the calculations, and make sure they are called at the right times.
	Work Items:
		1. Implement Scenario.Average and Section.PointsEarned - medium - done (moved to ItemContainer.Average with work item 2.2).
		2. Redo the class heirarchy - large - done.
			1. Change the Item class to an interface - medium - done.
			2. Create the ItemContainer class - medium - done.
			3. Make Section and Scenario inherit from ItemContainer - small - done.
		3. Add a method to calculate the Weight of each Grade - medium - done (the method currently never gets called).
			r1. Made the MainWin bigger - small - change.
			r2. Made sure the ScenarioTargetUpDown gets enabled/disabled at the right times - small - fix (actually, this wasn't finished, oops). 
			r3. Added a property to the Grade class that will store its weight in the overall Scenario - small (OverallWeight) - change.
		4. Rewrite the Item.Weight property to be a nullable double - medium - done.
			1. Write ConvertWeightToString - small - done.
			2. Change Item.Weight to a nullable double - small - done.
		5. Add a method that will calculate the PointsNeeded of every grade in a Scenario - large - in progress (CalculateNeeded) (quite buggy).
			r1. Made it impossible to resize the ItemMarkedColumn - small - fix.
			1. Write a method to calculate and store the OverallWeight of each Grade - medium - done (CalculuateOverallGradeWeights).
			r1. Added the Parent property to the Item interface and the Grade/Section classes, and added related functionality to their constructors and the code in MainWin.cs that initializes objects of those types - small - change.
			r2. Added the Level property to the Item interface and the Grade/Section classes, and added relaed functionality to their constructors and the code in MainWin.cs that initializes object of those types - small - change.
			2. Finish implementing CalculateNeeded for the "Even" mode - medium - done. 
			r1. Made sure the ScenarioTargetUpDown got enabled at the correct times (turns out I didn't actually finish in v0.3.2.3r2) - small - fix.
	Changes:
		1. Removed the overridden Grade.Weight property, and removed the "virtual" modifier from the Item.Weight property. The Weight for each Grade will be calculated outside the class (see work item 3) - small.
		2. Made the RowHeight of ScenarioList and ScenarioTree 25 pixels (this spaces out the lists and makes them more readable) - small.
		3. Made the Item.Weight property a string so it can be blank for Grades, for now - small.
		4. Added Row decorations for Sections and Grades - medium.
		5. Added a RowBorderDecoration for the selected item on the ScenarioTree - small.
		6. Added a RowBorderDecoration for the hot item on the ScenarioTree - small.
	Fixes:
		1. Made it impossible to perform a deselect on the ScenarioList by adding the ScenarioToReselect property - small.

Version 0.3
	Goal: Finish the GUI.
	Work Items:
		1. Add a NumericUpDown to input the Scenario's target grade - small - done (ScenarioTargetUpDown).
		2. Add a ComboBox to input the type of calculation that should be done - small - done (CalculationTypeComboBox).
		3. Add Buttons to delete Scenarios and Items, and implement them - small - done.
	Changes:
		1. Overloaded DeleteItem() so that you can call it with no arguments.
		2. Rewrote ScenarioTree_KeyDown() to use DeleteItem() without arguments (DeleteItemButton_Click() was written this way from the start).
	Fixes:
		1. Made sure that the two "delete" buttons are enabled/disabled at the right times.

Version 0.2
	Goal: Fix some of the existing GUI problems before moving on.
	Work Items:
		1. Create and finish the ItemMarkedColumn, using Decorations to hide checkboxes on Sections - large - done.
		2. Redo SelectedScenario as a property - small - done.
		3. Add keyboard support to the list and tree, and the ability to delete Scenarios and Items - medium - done.
			1. ScenarioList.KeyDown - small - done.
			2. ScenarioTree.KeyDown - medium - done.
		4. Make sure that the Scenario related buttons are disabled at the right times - medium - done.
			1. When Scenarios are added - small - done.
			2. When Items are added - small - done.
			3. When Scenarios are selected - small - done.
			4. When Items are selected - small - done.
			5. When Scenarios are deleted - small - done.
			6. When Items are deleted - small - done (also resets the Scenario's ItemType if the Scenario is empty).
	Changes:
	1. Changed Scenario.Average property to a string, and marked it as a TODO - small.
	2. Changed from ScenarioTree.Checkboxes = true to ScenarioTree.UseSubItemCheckboxes = true, in order to create the ItemMarkedColumn - small.
	3. Changed ScenarioTree and ScenarioList to use SelectionChanged events instead of SelectedIndexChanged - small.
	4. Moved Scenario deletion code to the new DeleteScenario() method.
	5. Moved Item deletion code to the new DeleteItem() method.
	Fixes:
	1. Fixed an issue that made the ScenarioTree perform atrociously slow with Sections (added the read-only Marked property to Section) - small.
	2. Fixed an issue that crashed BareMinimum whenever a subitem checkbox was checked. For some reason, the TreeListView calls GetChildren when this happens, even though it can only happen on a Grade, which doesn't have any children and thus was not previously handled by the GetChildren method - small.

Version 0.1
	Goal: Finish current work items and set future goals.
	Work Items:
	1. Finish the empty message overlay styling - small - done (opted for simple text).
	2. Set the text for the empty list message - small - done.
	3. Work on implementing each of the currently empty/unfinished event handlers - large - done.
		1. AddGradeButton_Click - medium - done.
		2. AddSectionButton_Click - medium - done.
		3. ScenarioTree_SelectedIndexChanged - small - done.
		4. ScenarioTree_CellEditStarting - small - done (as far as it can be until the ItemMarkedColumn is finished, see v0.2).
		5. ScenarioListView_SelectedIndexChanged - small - done.
	4. Make the Grade class functional for the current usage - small - done.
	5. Implement GetChildren delegate method - small - done.

Initial Reworking
	- Created the Scenario, Item, Section, and Grade classes.
	- Made the Scenario, Item, and Section classes functional for their basic usages.
	- Set up the ScenarioList and ScenarioTree.
	- Added the FileToolbar.
	- Added the AddScenarioButton, AddSectionButton, and AddGradeButton buttons.
